          <h3>2B</h3>
          <p>2B, a YoRha unit who is accompined by her partner 9S, her mission being to bring <strong><em>"Glory to Mankind"</em></strong></p>

          <h3>9S</h3>
          <p>9S, a YoRha unit who is 2Bs partner, he is a scanner unit that is more defensive than offensive, as a scanner
            his role differs from 2B, as he finds and analyzes informatio rather than fighting.

          <h3>A2</h3>
          <p> A2, the final <strong><em>"Main"</em></strong> YoRha unit, she is an old unit, as defined from her unit letter being first
          than her unit number. </p>
          <p>
            She is an interesting YoRha unit because unlike her supersets, she is able to speed/power up before self-destructing, 
            Meanwhile any future model simply is left visually and physically imparied
