/*
Have to figure out the order of the sub pages
Home, Characters and Abilities is what we 
have now, Home will stay, but the others have to be changed
I am unsure what would be interisting enough to 
put as one of the sub topics and such
here are some ideas to spit out

not neceszaarlily in that order
Home, Concept Art, Endings
Home will have the basic info about the game,
characters, and their looks
Concept Art will have the art of the game, videos
and images
Endings will have details about the multiple endings 
of Nier Automata
i think that is fine

learn to impliment more javascript to the website
how to add videos
how to add more images
how to change the apprance of the two subpages none Home
fix grammar, info, overall looks,
re host
eventually use a database for actual info recieve
put on githib/resume
